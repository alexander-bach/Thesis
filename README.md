### Overview

Welcome to the repository for my doctoral thesis titled "Empowering Ecological Research by Improving Access and Usability of Biodiversity Data - An Arachnological Perspective". This repository is organized by chapters and contains all the raw data, R scripts, and other resources needed to reproduce the results presented in my thesis.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories, each corresponding to a chapter of the thesis (excluding the introductionary chapters):

- **Chapter 3: The Tantalean Data Dilemma - Making Trapped Biodiversity Data FAIR Again**
  - Methods for extracting and transforming historical biodiversity data.
  - Data quality criteria and mobilization workflow.

- **Chapter 4: ARAapp - Interactive Exploratory Analysis Tools for Spider Community Data**
  - Development and description of the ARAapp.
  - Data pipeline design and exploratory analysis tools.

- **Chapter 5: Grassy Field Margins Revisited - Long-term Development of Taxonomic and Functional Diversity of Spiders in Intensively Used Agricultural Landscapes in Western Germany**
  - Raw data and R script for analyzing long-term changes in spider communities.

- **Chapter 6: Evaluating Urban Grassland Restoration Using Epigeic Spiders - A Case Study from Aachen, Germany** (this chapther is still in the publication process and will be published afterwards)
  - Analysis of spider data to assess grassland restoration efforts.

### Usage

Each chapter folder contains:

- **Raw Data**: The raw datasets used for analysis in the corresponding chapter.
- **Scripts**: R scripts and other code files necessary to reproduce the analyses and figures.

### Installation and Requirements

To reproduce the analyses, you will need:

- **R** and **RStudio**
- Required R packages (specified in the README files within each chapter directory)
