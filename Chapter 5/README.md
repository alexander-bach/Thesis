This repository contains the raw data and R script necessary to reproduce the results presented in Chapter 5 of my doctoral thesis. This chapter investigates the long-term development of spider diversity in field margins within intensively used agricultural landscapes in Western Germany.

<i>Contents</i>

    Raw Data: The raw vegetation and spider data collected from field margins at two different time points (T0 and T1).
    R Script: An R script that processes the raw data and performs the analyses described in the thesis.

<i>Raw Data</i>

The raw data files include:

    VegData.csv: Vegetation data, transformed according to McNellie et al. (2019)
    A2002.csv: Spider data from field margins in Aachen from 2002 (t0)
    A2018.csv: Spider data from field margins in Aachen from 2018 (t1)
    J2001.csv: Spider data from field margins in Juelich from 2001 (t0)
    J2018.csv: Spider data from field margins in Juelich from 2018 (t1)
    Sites_t0.csv: Combined site data from Aachen and Juelich for t0
    Sites_t1.csv: Combined site data from Aachen and Juelich for t1
    TraitData.csv: Spider Trait data
